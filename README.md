## Project Description
It's a fact that the use of data analytics in football is becoming more popular daily. We have multiple examples, such as Leicester City, surprising winner team of the Premier League in 2016 thanks to the implementation of an analysis of data in its structure. 

Another recent case it's the Kevin de Bruyne's, Manchester City Belgian footballer, who has signed his new contract renovation this year without the intermediation of an agent, thanks to data-driven decisions based on his performance in the team and the expected monetary reward that the club should pay him. 

Following this line, in this final project, we are aiming to predict the salary of a player based on features such as its performance on the pitch, and other characteristics such as the age or the league, among others, applying the statistical and Machine Learning techniques we learnt during the Bootcamp.

## Hypotheses / Questions
We would like to predict the expected salary of a professional player based on the performance on the pitch, the contribution to the team and other features.

We would like to prove the correlation between the features object to investigation with the amount of salary the teams should pay to each player.

In this project, we would like to see if some players are overpaid and other underpaid based in another caracteristics such as age or the league where they play.

The Null hypothesis will be the players are paid according to their performance, and the Alternative Hypothesis will be if other factors are involved on the players wage.


## Dataset
* Where did you get your data? If you downloaded a dataset (either public or private), describe where you downloaded it and include the command to load the dataset.
* Did you build your own datset? If so, did you use an API or a web scraper? PRovide the relevant scripts in your repo.
* For all types of datasets, provide a description of the size, complexity, and data types included in your dataset, as well as a schema of the tables if necessary.
* If the question cannot be answered with the available data, why not? What data would you need to answer it better?

## Cleaning
Describe your full process of data wrangling and cleaning. Document why you chose to fill missing values, extract outliers, or create the variables you did as well as your reasoning behind the process.

## Analysis
* Overview the general steps you went through to analyze your data in order to test your hypothesis.
* Document each step of your data exploration and analysis.
* Include charts to demonstrate the effect of your work.
* If you used Machine Learning in your final project, describe your feature selection process.

## Model Training and Evaluation
*Include this section only if you chose to include ML in your project.*
* Describe how you trained your model, the results you obtained, and how you evaluated those results.

## Conclusion
* Summarize your results. What do they mean?
* What can you say about your hypotheses?
* Interpret your findings in terms of the questions you try to answer.

## Future Work
Address any questions you were unable to answer, or any next steps or future extensions to your project.

## Workflow
Outline the workflow you used in your project. What were the steps?
How did you test the accuracy of your analysis and/or machine learning algorithm?

## Organization
How did you organize your work? Did you use any tools like a trello or kanban board?

What does your repository look like? Explain your folder and file structure.
